  Semantik: may_block, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller owns device storage and serializes all calls for it. Resource references and real queue fences define retained backing lifetime. Outputs never alias device storage or inputs..
- Slot 14, Offset 144: `copy_submit_ex` - Submits checked rows or linear bytes with exact upstream fences, preserving resources through physical completion. Different strides and native layouts use the common negotiated transport; unsupported opaque layouts never fall back to CPU address guessing.
  Semantik: may_block, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller owns device storage and serializes all calls for it. Resource references and real queue fences define retained backing lifetime. Outputs never alias device storage or inputs..
- Slot 15, Offset 152: `job_fence` - Exports the exact canonical fence for dependencies without waiting. Job and backing remain owned by their original receipts; exporting neither completes nor releases work.
  Semantik: may_block, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller owns device storage and serializes all calls for it. Resource references and real queue fences define retained backing lifetime. Outputs never alias device storage or inputs..
- Slot 16, Offset 160: `render_submit` - Submit immutable logical draw state to a ready native backend without pixel maps or synchronous GPU waits. Returns the common job/fence; unsupported leaves output unchanged for explicit software fallback.

- Slot 17, Offset 168: `image_prepare` - Reuse a compatible image or explicitly allocate and asynchronously copy/convert its layout within a byte budget. No image scaling or hidden per-draw preparation. Unknown modifiers cannot be interpreted as linear; scanout preparation does not activate an output.
  Semantik: may_block, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Preparation may wait for native allocation, outside frame submission. Retained resource and copy job/fence use the existing lifecycle. Output/ready fence bytes remain unchanged on failure; failed cleanup stays tracked by the device..
- Slot 18, Offset 176: `image_present` - Submit an already rendered image through the shared active-output owner and queue. Device capability device_gpu_present is required; incompatible size, adapter or format is rejected. No scanout handle or NVIDIA detail crosses the library boundary.
  Semantik: nonblocking, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Copies request/dependencies and retains source through the existing job lifecycle. A Busy result has no output side effects; leave the previous complete image visible and retry from the event loop..
- Slot 19, Offset 184: `render_submit_list` - Submit a bounded native draw list through the common queue. Capability device_gpu_render_list is required. No CPU image mapping, application device words, blocking wait or per-draw queue fence.

- Slot 26, Offset 240: `swapchain_resize` - Drain obsolete frames through the same cleanup before atomically rebinding a complete pool; old frame tokens remain stale.
  Semantik: nonblocking, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller serializes this device. Bounded chain/frame identities retain resources and exact jobs until actual retirement. No global wait or timer-derived completion..

- Slot 29, Offset 264: `render_submit_grid_list` - Submit immutable draw/grid pairs through the common native queue. Exact rotation and rational scaling sample logical cells without CPU image reconstruction. No accepted prefix, per-draw fence or hardware command language.
  Semantik: nonblocking, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Copies every draw and dependency; retains the common source and target until physical job retirement. No accepted prefix on admission error..
- Slot 30, Offset 272: `memory_info` - Advances one already-started bounded residency transition and reports its actual retained owner state. No new eviction or restoration is started.
  Semantik: may_block, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller owns device storage and serializes all calls for it. Resource references and real queue fences define retained backing lifetime. Outputs never alias device storage or inputs..
- Slot 31, Offset 280: `memory_trim` - Starts at most one idle managed-image readback, selecting lowest priority then least recent use. Returns OK when scheduled, BUSY while a transaction is already held, LIMIT when no victim is eligible. The finite deadline cancels logical work but never releases active copy endpoints.
  Semantik: may_block, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller owns device storage and serializes all calls for it. Resource references and real queue fences define retained backing lifetime. Outputs never alias device storage or inputs..
- Slot 32, Offset 288: `resource_resident` - Requires an owned managed offscreen image. Returns OK once native contents are ready, BUSY while queued or restoring. Pending requests use descending resource priority then arrival order. New backing is published only after the exact upload receipt is physically retired; the public resource handle remains unchanged.
  Semantik: may_block, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller owns device storage and serializes all calls for it. Resource references and real queue fences define retained backing lifetime. Outputs never alias device storage or inputs..

- ELF-Symbol: `r4gfx_color_v1`
- ABI-Major: 1
- Revision: 2
- Interface-ID: `0x31584647:0x524f4c43`
- Tabellengroesse: 136 Byte

- Slot 0, Offset 32: `color_description_validate` - Validate a named color description without changing outputs or enabling hardware.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller retains separate storage and serializes each profile; independent profiles share no mutable transform or allocator. Input/output ranges must not overlap retained storage. No host file I/O..
- Slot 1, Offset 40: `color_profile_storage_size` - Recommended caller capacity for one ICC transform; no allocation or global state.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller retains separate storage and serializes each profile; independent profiles share no mutable transform or allocator. Input/output ranges must not overlap retained storage. No host file I/O..
- Slot 2, Offset 48: `color_profile_open` - Compile the complete ICC transform in bounded caller storage. No active profile handle is published on failure.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller retains separate storage and serializes each profile; independent profiles share no mutable transform or allocator. Input/output ranges must not overlap retained storage. No host file I/O..
- Slot 3, Offset 56: `color_profile_info` - Read the current generation and admitted profile policy.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller retains separate storage and serializes each profile; independent profiles share no mutable transform or allocator. Input/output ranges must not overlap retained storage. No host file I/O..
- Slot 4, Offset 64: `color_profile_apply` - Apply an admitted, retained RGB ICC transform to caller float triplets.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller retains separate storage and serializes each profile; independent profiles share no mutable transform or allocator. Input/output ranges must not overlap retained storage. No host file I/O..
- Slot 5, Offset 72: `color_profile_close` - Close the exact generation, remove its private ICC context and release caller storage for reuse. Repeated close succeeds; a replaced generation reports STALE.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller retains separate storage and serializes each profile; independent profiles share no mutable transform or allocator. Input/output ranges must not overlap retained storage. No host file I/O..
- Slot 6, Offset 80: `color_image_transform` - Convert, resample or composite explicit8/10-bit/FP16 RGB images with retained ICC profiles. No allocation, driver calls or per-pixel profile recompilation. Source interpolation and alpha blending occur in linear light; transfer/range/quantization occur when storing the target.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller serializes each retained profile and exclusively owns writable target storage. All descriptors, statistics and ICC state must be separate from writable pixels. Independent image/profile operations share no mutable state..
- Slot 7, Offset 88: `color_resource_create` - Create or import an image with immutable named color metadata through the normal graphics resource owner. No alternate BO allocator.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller serializes each graphics device and retains source/target resources through the operation. Independent devices share no mutable allocator or color state. CPU transforms require separately mappable images; native rendering uses ordinary retained queue jobs..
- Slot 8, Offset 96: `color_resource_info` - Read immutable color metadata. Untagged legacy images report UNSUPPORTED; format alone never invents HDR color meaning.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller serializes each graphics device and retains source/target resources through the operation. Independent devices share no mutable allocator or color state. CPU transforms require separately mappable images; native rendering uses ordinary retained queue jobs..
- Slot 9, Offset 104: `color_resource_transform` - Execute the same linear CPU color pipeline on retained system/borrowed graphics resources. Map each distinct resource once, respect pending GPU ownership, retain failed unmaps for later cleanup. Native-only images report unsupported; this operation does not silently read VRAM. On failure discard the offscreen result.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Caller serializes each graphics device and retains source/target resources through the operation. Independent devices share no mutable allocator or color state. CPU transforms require separately mappable images; native rendering uses ordinary retained queue jobs..
- Slot 10, Offset 112: `color_profile_generate` - Generate a deterministic ICC profile in caller memory through the same userland ICC engine used for display transforms. No host file access. Use16-aligned exclusive scratch of at least1KB and at most64MB (2MB normally suffices), output capacity132..4MB (4KB suffices for these matrix/curve profiles). All writable storage, definition and size output must be separate. Scratch is temporary and may not contain retained profiles. Output/count publish only on success; no color assumption is made for unspecified image metadata.
  Semantik: nonblocking, thread_safe, reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: All storage belongs to caller and is used only during this call. Generated bytes are independent of scratch and may be passed to color_profile_open..
- Slot 11, Offset 120: `color_render_submit` - Submit1..16 compatible draws using explicit retained resource colors and a fixed native color program. Requires device_gpu_color, a nearest sampler and request.transfer=identity. R4GFX derives matrices, transfer/range, white scaling and optional tone/gamut/dither; the queue retains copied coefficients and BOs until real execution. Untagged/ICC resources are rejected by this named-color shader. CPU ICC processing remains available through COLOR_V1. Failure admits no prefix and does not write output.
  Semantik: nonblocking, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Copies every draw and dependency; retains the common source and target until physical job retirement. No accepted prefix on admission error..
- Slot 12, Offset 128: `color_render_submit_grid` - Color-render1..16 compatible draws with per-draw exact logical grids in one native job. Same color/resource/dependency rules as color_render_submit; requires device_gpu_color_grid. Rotation and DPI sampling precede the shared color transform. No CPU mapping, intermediate image or partial admission.
  Semantik: nonblocking, caller_serialized, not_reentrant; Fehlerdomaene `R4GFX_STATUS`; Besitz: Copies every draw and dependency; retains the common source and target until physical job retirement. No accepted prefix on admission error..

Typen
-----

- `R4GfxLinearLayout`: 32 Byte, Alignment 8. Feste V1-Payload. Adressen sind ausschliesslich CPU-Maps.
- `R4GfxCpuImage`: 40 Byte, Alignment 8. Feste V1-Payload. Adressen sind ausschliesslich CPU-Maps.
- `R4GfxRect`: 16 Byte, Alignment 4. Feste V1-Payload. Adressen sind ausschliesslich CPU-Maps.
- `R4GfxRenderCaps`: 48 Byte, Alignment 8. Fixed capability snapshot; no GPU or native display claim.
- `R4GfxCpuDraw`: 64 Byte, Alignment 4. Fixed ordered 2D command. Equal-size same-view blit supports memmove; other source/target aliases are rejected.
- `R4GfxCpuBatch`: 40 Byte, Alignment 8. Synchronous caller-owned batch. All metadata and CPU maps stay valid and exclusively bound until return; no allocation or retained pointer.
- `R4GfxCpuStats`: 32 Byte, Alignment 8. Only written after successful validation and execution; rejected batches preserve output and image bytes.
- `R4GfxDevice`: 16 Byte, Alignment 8. Caller-owned storage identity. Memory stays valid through successful close; first allocation must be zeroed. Reopening the same retained storage advances its generation.
- `R4GfxDeviceConfig`: 40 Byte, Alignment 8. Version 1; storage_size bytes aligned to 8, borrowed R4XStartContext for this caller. Preferred adapter zero selects automatically. software_only prevents native selection. Storage and outputs must not overlap input/start metadata.
- `R4GfxDeviceInfo`: 120 Byte, Alignment 8. Software render capabilities and separately negotiated native copy capabilities. Counters are actual work; direct imports do not count as uploads. Refresh changes GPU identity only, preserving portable sources.
- `R4GfxResource`: 32 Byte, Alignment 8. Opaque, nonwrapping resource identity local to one device storage generation. Retain/release are explicit; jobs hold independent internal references.
- `R4GfxResourceDesc`: 88 Byte, Alignment 8. Image, immutable sampler or 2D pipeline. Image source is a new system BO, pointer to canonical GfxBufferHandle, pointer to GuiSharedRasterLease, or explicitly borrowed CPU image. Image target flag permits writes; immutable rasters cannot be targets. Import forms derive image geometry from the canonical BO. Borrowed CPU bytes remain valid while any reference/job exists. Unused fields are zero. Native source4 instead points to R4GfxNativeImage with explicit deadline and requested layout; unused CPU image/source-generation fields stay zero.
- `R4GfxResourceInfo`: 112 Byte, Alignment 8. Source provenance and current logical reference count. Image addresses are exposed only for explicitly borrowed CPU sources; BO CPU mapping remains internal and transient.
- `R4GfxDraw`: 168 Byte, Alignment 8. Ordered 2D operation through immutable pipeline and sampler resources. Fill uses zero source/sampler/source_rect/opacity. Blit uses opacity 255; over uses premultiplied alpha.
- `R4GfxRenderBatch`: 24 Byte, Alignment 8. Borrowed array of R4GfxDraw. Reuses RENDER_V1 limits and all-before-write validation. No service IPC per draw; unavailable native operations use the shared CPU renderer.
- `R4GfxRenderStats`: 40 Byte, Alignment 8. Actual execution backend and byte counts. fallback is one only when the selected native device used software for unsupported drawing features.
- `R4GfxCopyRequest`: 96 Byte, Alignment 8. Asynchronous whole-range BO copy on the selected common queue. Borrowed CPU pointers are never submitted as GPU addresses. Serial queue ordering applies; explicit deadline uses the platform monotonic clock.
- `R4GfxJob`: 32 Byte, Alignment 8. Device-local copy-job identity. A terminal logical result is independent of physical resource retirement. Release requires actual resources_released.
- `R4GfxJobInfo`: 56 Byte, Alignment 8. Canonical queue phase/result/flags, including device_active/resources_held, and original fence identity. Backend reports where the job ran; a software completion is not a GPU completion.
- `R4GfxCopyFence`: 40 Byte, Alignment 8. Exact common GfxFence wire identity. Export adds no reference: keep the job until a dependency has been admitted. Canonical admission retains its own dependency; copying numbers alone never proves completion.
- `R4GfxCopyRequestEx`: 136 Byte, Alignment 8. Version1 exact-size input. Zero rows is a linear copy and requires zero pitches; otherwise copy.byte_length is bytes per row. Up to eight borrowed R4GfxCopyFence dependencies, zero address for zero count. The complete descriptor and identities are captured before admission; no pointer survives the call.
- `R4GfxNativeImage`: 32 Byte, Alignment 8. Copied native image allocation intent for source_create_native. source_address points to this payload; source_generation and ResourceDesc.image remain zero. The selected native adapter and memory generation bind allocation. Returned resource information exposes the actual pitch and byte length.
- `R4GfxSignedRect`: 16 Byte, Alignment 4. Signed source, destination or clipping rectangle for asynchronous rendering.
- `R4GfxRenderRequest`: 216 Byte, Alignment 8. Copied asynchronous native draw. Resolves logical resources to the common queue and returns the existing job/fence identity; never maps or scales image pixels. Requires device_gpu_render; unsupported adapters retain the existing software render API. Resources stay held until job_release after physical retirement.
- `R4GfxImagePrepareRequest`: 96 Byte, Alignment 8. Prepare outside the frame path: texture1/render2/scanout4; preference0=compatible,1=linear,2=blocklinear,flags1=force copy. Byte budget bounds additional image allocation; zero permits reuse only. Up to8 input fences and caller-owned output-ready fence storage. Reuse forwards dependencies; conversion returns its single dependent copy fence. Ready storage must not alias request/result/device; input/output fence arrays may overlap. No input pointer retained.
- `R4GfxPreparedImage`: 80 Byte, Alignment 8. Caller owns one returned image reference and, for conversion, its asynchronous copy job. Flags1=copy pending,2=software image,4=reused. dependency_count fences were written to the caller ready array; pass them to a subsequent draw. Successful prepare is not copy completion. Release the job only after physical retirement, and release the image reference independently.
- `R4GfxImagePresentRequest`: 72 Byte, Alignment 8. Present one complete native XRGB image to the active output at unchanged dimensions. frame_key is a nonzero producer generation; deadline_ns is a finite absolute deadline. At most8 copied dependencies; reserved is zero. Return is ordinary R4GfxJob ownership. Source stays retained until job_release after physical retirement. Completion means the device copied into private scanout storage; visible scanout remains the platform DisplayPresentationStats receipt. No CPU image mapping or blocking GPU wait.
- `R4GfxRenderListRequest`: 24 Byte, Alignment 8. Copied array of 1..16 R4GfxRenderRequest records. All records share source, target, pipeline, sampler, transfer and deadline. Only the first record carries dependencies; rectangles, color and opacity may vary. One ordinary retained job covers the entire native list. All metadata validates before any submission; reserved is zero.
- `R4GfxPresentationInfo`: 112 Byte, Alignment 8. Per-head real presentation capabilities. Flags and policy bits match the documented R4GFX presentation constants; observations are monotonic CPU times, never GPU-clock conversions.
- `R4GfxSwapchain`: 32 Byte, Alignment 8. Opaque chain identity tied to its exact device storage; resize changes frame generation while preserving this chain identity.
- `R4GfxSwapchainDesc`: 40 Byte, Alignment 8. Copies and retains2..3 distinct R4GfxResource images from images. Head/output generation and all image geometry must match. flags bit0 requires hardware VSync. Existing image resources determine native or software presentation. No per-frame allocation.
- `R4GfxSwapchainFrame`: 56 Byte, Alignment 8. Acquired image and exact frame identity. Caller may render only while acquired; Present transfers its lifetime to the chain. Release succeeds only after all render/consumer readers retire, or for an unused acquired image.
- `R4GfxSwapchainPresent`: 112 Byte, Alignment 8. Queues one acquired image with an optional same-device render job; zero job means CPU rendering is already finished. The chain retains that job while pending. All frames have a finite deadline. intent0 composition/copy,1 preferred direct,2 preferred overlay; blockers describe competing consumers. Unsupported direct/overlay requests select composition/copy. Blockers: bit0 nonopaque,bit1 other windows,bit2 readers,bit3 software cursor,bit4 menus,bit5 force composition. Admission and actual dispatch recheck the selected native capability. A visible direct image remains consumer-held until its own fence physically retires; close requests restoration before releasing it.
- `R4GfxSwapchainFrameStatus`: 144 Byte, Alignment 8. Bounded frame status. phase0free/1acquired/2queued/3submitted/4terminal; result0pending/1presented/2copied/3discarded/4failed/5lost. held_flags bit0 render,bit1 consumer. Times use monotonic nanoseconds; zero is unknown. selected_ns is a predicted scanout opportunity, not observed VBlank. copied/visible/released are distinct actual receipts.
- `R4GfxSwapchainStatus`: 480 Byte, Alignment 8. Snapshot after one bounded nonblocking progress step. life0active/1occluded/2suboptimal/3lost/4closing. Explicit frame records avoid borrowed output arrays. next_start_ns may be combined with an ordinary event wait.
- `R4GfxPresentationPlan`: 96 Byte, Alignment 8. Compositor eligibility request. flags: bit0 opaque,bit1 sole visible surface,bit2 other readers,bit3 software cursor,bit4 menus,bit5 force composition. Only identity color/transform and exact unscaled geometry can use direct/overlay in this contract.
- `R4GfxPresentationDecision`: 24 Byte, Alignment 8. Selected path0 software copy/1 native composition-copy/2 direct/3 overlay. reasons bits: format1/layout2/geometry4/color8/readers16/cursor32/windows64/menus128/capability256/explicit512. Pure eligibility does not submit, allocate or claim visibility.
- `R4GfxLogicalGrid`: 64 Byte, Alignment 4. Exact native-pixel-center to logical-cell and guest-edge sampling; binary layout matches GfxSampleGrid. The all-zero grid selects ordinary sampling. See copied render grid list semantics.
- `R4GfxRenderGridListRequest`: 32 Byte, Alignment 8. Copied arrays of1..16 R4GfxRenderRequest and R4GfxLogicalGrid records. Same batching/resource/dependency rules as render_submit_list. All inputs validate before native submission; requires device_gpu_grid. No CPU pixel mapping or scaling.
- `R4GfxColorDescription`: 48 Byte, Alignment 4. Explicit immutable RGB encoding. Version1/size48; flags/reserved0. Alpha stays linear and full range. Electrical premultiplication occurs after transfer encoding; optical premultiplication before encoding. Float16 is full-range linear. PQ is absolute; a reference-white value never rescales its EOTF. These facts do not establish native output capability. ICC primaries4 and transfer5 must appear together, with full range, equal peak/reference white and no optical premultiplication. Their retained profile is the authoritative complete RGB characterization; named transfer math cannot substitute for it. Float16 permits linear or ICC storage. An input GRAY ICC profile uses equal replicated RGB channels; unequal input channels are rejected. Output profiles remain RGB. Range2 derives legal endpoints from storage precision; range3/4/5 explicitly uses8/10/16-bit signal endpoints after storage promotion. These ranges do not imply native output capability.
- `R4GfxColorProfile`: 16 Byte, Alignment 8. Caller-owned profile state handle. Retain its storage until close; copying a handle does not retain a second profile. Close/open never revives a previous generation.
- `R4GfxColorProfileConfig`: 56 Byte, Alignment 8. Version1/size56. Storage is16-byte aligned, first16 bytes initially zero, and retained through close. profile_storage_size recommends capacity; smaller buffers can fail with LIMIT. The complete ICC bytes are copied on open. Input direction accepts RGB input/display/color-space profiles; output requires an RGB display profile. Explicit intents0..3 use ICC tag precedence, including the standard A2B0/B2A0 fallback when the requested intent has no dedicated LUT. Flags select black-point compensation and output VCGT calibration. The CMM builds the actual admitted transform; LUT profiles are not approximated by matrix/TRC profiles.
- `R4GfxColorProfileInfo`: 40 Byte, Alignment 8. Current private ICC context capacity/use and admitted direction, intent and calibration flags. Last numeric LittleCMS error is diagnostic; hardware capability is separate.
- `R4GfxColorProfileRequest`: 24 Byte, Alignment 8. Nonoverlapping,4-byte aligned arrays of packed three-f32 triplets. Source/destination storage must be retained for this call. Input profiles convert encoded RGB to relative XYZ(D50); output profiles perform the reverse and optionally apply VCGT once. Alpha, physical luminance and composition remain with the R4GFX color pipeline. Nonfinite source samples and malformed ranges fail before output writes. At most16777216 pixels; reserved0.
- `R4GfxColorImage`: 112 Byte, Alignment 8. Version1/size112. Explicit CPU storage and immutable color description. A zero profile is required for named encodings; ICC primaries/transfer require a live profile of the appropriate direction, retained and serialized through the call. No hidden sRGB assumption for HDR or ICC data. AB48 CPU images hold little-endian RGBA16 unorm, precision17. Convert to a named native format before uploading.
- `R4GfxColorTransform`: 64 Byte, Alignment 8. Version1/size64. Nearest/bilinear sampling and BLIT/OVER operate in premultiplied display-linear BT.2020 cd/m2. Opacity0..65535 is linear. Flags: output mapping applies the documented rational luminance shoulder and neutral-axis gamut compression; relative white scales source paper white to target; dither is spatially anchored in target coordinates. ICC output requires output mapping and BLIT; perform composition in a linear intermediate first. Bounded by render_max_pixels. Input/target pixel storage cannot overlap. Validation errors preserve target bytes; a runtime ICC/nonfinite failure invalidates the offscreen result, which the caller must discard.
- `R4GfxColorResourceDesc`: 144 Byte, Alignment 8. Version1/size144; nested resource descriptor retains its unchanged version1/size88. Named RGB description is copied and immutable for the resource lifetime, including prepared/relocated views. ICC images are transformed to a named working space before GPU resource creation; a raw ICC pointer is never retained by a queue job. High-precision storage requires explicit color metadata. This does not establish scanout or HDR capability.
- `R4GfxColorProfileDefinition`: 64 Byte, Alignment 4. Version1/size64; reserved0. Explicit RGB(model1) or grayscale(model2) characterization. xy chromaticities and decoding gamma exponents use1/100000. Curve1 is pure power, curve2 is exact sRGB. Gamma must be0.01..100 even for unused channels; choose1 for sRGB. Gray uses the white point and first curve, produces a GRAY ICC profile, and accepts only equal RGB channels in the image/API storage. Generated RGB profiles can characterize inputs or displays; no measurement/calibration is claimed.
- `R4GfxMemoryInfo`: 104 Byte, Alignment 8. Device-owned residency accounting. Aliases are deduplicated. Pinned/reclaimable bytes are subsets; pending backing and global kernel charges may outlive logical replacement. No claim of actual GPU free space.

Besitzregeln
------------

- CPU-Map: fill_rect borgt nur die CPU-Adresse waehrend des Aufrufs. Der Caller haelt eine exklusive CPU-Schreibmap des gemeinsamen R4DRAW-BO-Vertrags und fuehrt danach unmap aus. Keine verborgene Kopie, GPU-Adresse oder VRAM-Lesung.
- Layout: Lineares RAM-Bild. Andere Modifier, GPU-Seitentabellen, Speicherallokation und Scanout bleiben bei ihren Besitzern.
- RENDER_V1 maps: R4GfxCpuImage addresses are caller-owned readable/writable CPU maps, never physical or GPU addresses. The caller holds exclusive target access, read access to sources, and immutable metadata until return. Different virtual mappings of the same backing must not be presented as independent images.
- RENDER_V1 execution: Commands execute in order with an explicit total-pixel budget. Whole rectangles must already be clipped by the caller. Images and output may not alias metadata. Complete validation precedes every write; no hidden frame copy, allocation, thread or graphics service.
- RENDER_V1 colors: Source-over uses premultiplied ARGB8888 and integer rounding; XRGB is opaque with zero stored padding byte. Blit converts XRGB/ARGB and scales with pixel-center nearest or bilinear filtering clamped to the source rectangle. R8 supports fill/blit, not source-over. Color space conversion remains a separate stage.
- device_storage: DEVICE_V1 storage belongs to one serialized caller. Keep its allocation, start context and imported R4Ls alive through successful device_close. No R4L-global allocator or context. Library outputs and original batch metadata never alias writable image bytes or internal storage.
- resource_retirement: Logical release and device change never prove GPU quiescence. Jobs retain their exact canonical fences and BO sources until actual resource retirement. Portable CPU/immutable raster sources remain reconstructable after backend reset. Driver mapping caches may retain bounded backing until confirmed eviction.
