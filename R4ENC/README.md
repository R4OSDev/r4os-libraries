# R4ENC

Independent encoder library introduced in 0.79.41. The generated
`ENCODE_V1:1` contract separates canonical input BOs/fences, stream timestamps,
explicit codec/rate capabilities, bounded queues and immutable bitstream
leases. It does not reuse the R4VIDEO decoder API.

Implemented software path:

- C/Zig contract and canonical graphics identity checks.
- BO admission with deduplicated imports, finite retained-memory accounting,
  borrowed producer fences, CPU I420/NV12 views and retryable cleanup.
- Queue/control bookkeeping with backpressure, exact lease identities, ordered
  completion, IDR after Abort and Close escalation over pending Drain/Abort.
- Pinned OpenH264 2.6.0 freestanding C++/x86 assembly build; CQP H.264
  Constrained Baseline 8-bit 4:2:0, IDR/P, checked Annex-B access units.
- Loadable R4ENC.R4L with all nine public calls, R4SYS memory/clock/TLS adapters
  and one bounded worker per encoder, charged through its exact join.

The public software runtime passed a short SMP4 guest run with real BOs,
I420/NV12 inputs, bounded backlog, held output leases, Abort/IDR, Close and
exact worker joins. Independent FFmpeg decoding verified two twelve-frame
320x192 sequences at QP18/QP36. This is not a throughput or NVENC proof.
The private NVENC session now owns bounded work/bitstream BOs, two opaque
reconstructed references, IDR/P sequencing and fresh status validation.
It uses Shared/Native/gpu_resources.zig, including exact physical retirement
after timeout. Its Ampere/Ada SDK-dispatch model passes within the existing
second component case; no input pixels or actual codec execution are modeled.
The private encodePrepared boundary requires fully padded NV12 in NVENC
16x16 tile storage; it does not accept or reinterpret generic block-linear BOs.
The public NVIDIA path now selects matching Ampere/Ada NVENC and GR classes
and uses this session through its existing bounded worker. It starts GPU work
only for accepted input, applies one deadline to preparation/encoding and
retires both engines before input/close acknowledgements. Abort resets the
reference chain. Explicit NVIDIA requests never silently select software.

The GR preparer samples retained NV12/I420 directly, including authenticated
block-linear textures, and writes edge-padded private16x16 NV12 storage. Only
shader/packet/command/status/bitstream BOs are CPU-mapped; no full-frame
readback or extra intermediate copy is required. Private layout qualification
and actual NVENC output remain physical follow-up. Native configuration is
CQP,8-bit BT.709 limited, transfer1 or sRGB13, default/left chroma, GOP<=65535; unsupported metadata,
layouts, generations or missing channels return explicit errors. Capability
queries describe this software profile, not a completed physical qualification.
The compiled recording_mux helper writes bounded append-only Matroska/H.264
with explicit packet durations. Twelve real encoder packets preserve variable
PTS/durations and decoded pixels through independent demux. The companion
recording_pixels helper converts immutable CPU sRGB snapshots to limited NV12
with left chroma and explicit transfer13; it has no resource or thread owner.
Desktop's Ctrl+Print Screen recorder owns activation, latest-frame selection,
explicit fallback, file rotation and the worker. Its SMP4 consumer run decoded
62 pictures independently and checked delayed/failed writes, modeled NVIDIA
loss, repeated recording, exact joins and restored BO/capture baselines.
Physical NVENC execution remains unqualified. CBR/VBR constants define requests; they do
not imply backend support.

Build the module from Libraries with `./Build.sh R4ENC -Doffline=true` (or
`Build.bat R4ENC -Doffline=true`). Source archives must already be cached for
offline builds. From Libraries, use `./Build.sh R4ENC test` or `Build.bat R4ENC test` for the two
short component cases. The ownership case also exercises BO cleanup and flow
control with modeled kernel replies. No new workspace gate is added.

`Tools/BuildNative.ps1` uses PowerShell 7, clang 19.1.7, NASM >=2.16 and the bundled
Zig math sources. `-Offline` requires the checksum-pinned archive. Both host
paths share the script; execution has so far been checked on Linux only.
OpenH264's global thread pool is unavailable; the caller-owned R4OS worker runs
a single-thread codec with actual CPU SIMD dispatch. C++ is closed to exceptions
and RTTI; `-fcheck-new` preserves the codec's null-allocation checks.

## AMD provider foundation (0.80.28)

ENCODE_V1 preserves existing slots and appends AMD backend ID 2 and common
codec/profile constants. Canonical AMD native resources support an encode
IB, coherent status/command BOs and exact fence/retirement ownership. Profile
eligibility includes only VCN1 H.264/HEVC 8-bit; HEVC Main10, AV1 and unproven
B-frame operation are excluded. The 0.80.31 implementation below resolves this foundation through the
actual driver and its implemented session/rate-control profile.
The NVIDIA path requires its own provider identity. Physical codec output
and rate/quality tests belong to /39; AMDVCN08028 documents current evidence.

## AMD VCN1 encoder (0.80.31)

R4ENC 0.1.3 implements native H.264 Baseline/Main/High and HEVC Main8 via
ENCODE_V1 backend2. It reuses the existing worker, queues, timestamps,
immutable output leases, Abort/Drain/Close and budget ownership. Both native
providers remain explicit; the software and NVIDIA profiles retain their
previous behavior.

Pinned Mesa 26.2.2 VCN1 session, header, slice-template and rate-control
functions are extracted without changes by R4AMD/Tools/VcnEncode.ps1 and
compiled into R4ENC. The bounded adapter owns two reconstructed surfaces,
one previous reference and IDR/P sequencing. Firmware0x0310f005 selects
session ABI1.9 and the extended per-picture controls. A fresh feedback
record and retired native fence are both required before returning bytes.
Timeouts retain input/session storage through retirement; Close requires
its firmware command acknowledgement or a changed device epoch after the
old queue has retired. Only commands, feedback and compressed bytes are
mapped on the CPU. Source pixels remain native borrowed NV12 BOs.

Configuration: even dimensions128x128..4096x2304 for AVC, width>=130 for
HEVC; level5.2/6.2 and their sample-rate bounds, <=240fps, GOP1..65535,
CQP/CBR/peak-constrained VBR, QP0..51, rate-controlled peak<=200Mbps.
Color is BT.709 limited, transfer1 or13, default/left chroma. One contiguous
linear NV12 BO uses 256-byte-aligned pitch, explicit plane offset, padded
16-row AVC or64-row HEVC coded extent and sufficient initialized storage.
Separate planes, tiled input, B pictures, Main10 encoding and AV1 are not
implemented. Packet capacity is8192..8MB including up to1024 header bytes.

Existing host cases cover GOP/reset, rate controls, fresh/invalid feedback,
no input CPU mapping and late init/frame/close acknowledgements. A short
SMP4 guest ran the actual R4L/ENCODE_V1 worker through13 sessions and73
inputs, held-packet Drain, Abort/IDR, Close and exact worker joins. GPU
completion and VCL data are modeled. Independent FFmpeg checks parse36
production SPS/PPS/VPS vectors,24 reconstructed IDR/P slice headers and
decode small software reference clips;
the latter exercise Annex-B admission, not AMD output quality. Real VCN
bitstreams, rates and laptop performance remain reserved for0.80.39.
